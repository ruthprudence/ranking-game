# Priority Sorter
## Ranking Solution
### by Ruth Prudence

### Summary
React excels at creating dynamic user interfaces, which is perfect for the [**Priority Sorter**](https://github.com/ruthprudence/priority-sorter).

I went with React Native for Mobile since it uses React's principles and allows me to use the same codebase for both iOS and Android.

1. React's state management handles dynamic input fields, where users can add items.

1. After submission pairwise item combinations are generated. 

1. Two items at a time are presented to the user; When a user selects an item, this choice is recorded, and the next pair is then presented.

1. The state is updated each time a selection is made.

1. Each selection contributes to the score of an item. 

1. After all pairs are evaluated, the final scores are calculated and the items are ranked accordingly.

1. Finally, results are displayed in a report card format showing the ranking of each item.
