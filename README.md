# Ranking Game

## Introduction

This is a demonstration of my back-end and front-end development: a simple app with tests written, intended to scale.

I decided to use React because it would handle the single-page nature of the app well. I went with Redux to handle state properties throughout the app. I started with an MVC (model view controller) approach, then eventually upgrading to a component/feature model utilizing slices and reducers to handle logic/flow.

I started with a web view and eventually migrated to React Native so display worked best mobile-first. There's plenty of room for growth.
