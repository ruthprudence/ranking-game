# Ranking Game

## Introduction

This web app is built with JavaScript (**React/Redux**, **Express**, **Jest**)--demonstrating my full-stack development, testing, and project management skills.

See live demo: [ruthprudence.com/rg](https://ruthprudence.com/rg/)

I used React because of the app's single-page nature; I went with Redux for managing state properties throughout. I'm using a component/feature model (upgraded from an MVC pattern) utilizing slices and reducers to handle logic/flow. The latter especially allows the app to scale, and eventually migrate to React Native.
